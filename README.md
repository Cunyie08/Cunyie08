## 🔍 What I Work On
- Applied **machine learning** (classification, regression, clustering)
- End-to-end ML pipelines: data preparation → modeling → evaluation
- **Generative AI systems** (RAG, LLM-based applications)
- **Agentic AI concepts** (tool use, orchestration, multi-step reasoning)
- Learning and experimenting with **transformer architectures** and **LLM fine-tuning**
- Translating complex data problems into practical, scalable solutions

---

## 🧠 Current Learning Focus
- Transformer architecture (attention mechanisms, embeddings)
- LLM fine-tuning workflows and evaluation
- Agentic system design and reasoning loops
- Robust prompt engineering and AI system reliability
