# Hi, I’m Kanyisola 👋🏽

I’m a **Data Scientist and AI Engineer** with a strong engineering background, building machine learning and AI systems with real-world impact across public sector, health, and finance.

I’m currently completing an **MSc in Data Science** alongside an **AI Engineering Fellowship**, with growing specialization in **machine learning, generative AI, agentic systems, and transformer-based models**.

---

## 🔍 What I Work On
- Applied **machine learning** (classification, regression, clustering)
- End-to-end ML pipelines: data preparation → modeling → evaluation
- **Generative AI systems** (RAG, LLM-based applications)
- **Agentic AI concepts** (tool use, orchestration, multi-step reasoning)
- Learning and experimenting with **transformer architectures** and **LLM fine-tuning**
- Translating complex data problems into practical, scalable solutions

---

## 🧠 Current Learning Focus
- Transformer architecture (attention mechanisms, embeddings)
- LLM fine-tuning workflows and evaluation
- Agentic system design and reasoning loops
- Robust prompt design and AI system reliability
